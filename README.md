# 🧾 Bill Management System with Login (Tkinter)

This is a Python-based Bill Management System GUI application that includes a basic login system. It allows users to calculate the total bill for selected food items and reset input fields easily.

## 🔐 Login System

A simple login interface is included to protect access to the billing system.
